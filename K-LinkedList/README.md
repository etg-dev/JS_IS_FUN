## What is linkedList ?

A linked list is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations, but instead each element has a reference to the next element in the list.

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    // The value of the node
    this.value = value;
    // The reference to the next node in the list
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    // The head of the linked list
    this.head = null;
    // The tail of the linked list
    this.tail = null;
    // The number of nodes in the linked list
    this.length = 0;
  }

  addToTail(value) {
    // Create a new node with the given value
    const newNode = new Node(value);
    // If the linked list is empty, set the new node as both the head and tail
    if (!this.head) {
      this.head = newNode;
    } else {
      // Otherwise, set the next node of the current tail to be the new node
      this.tail.next = newNode;
    }
    // Set the new node as the current tail
    this.tail = newNode;
    // Increment the length of the linked list
    this.length++;
  }

  // Other methods (such as removeFromHead, getValueAtIndex, etc.) can be added here
}
```

One advantage of linked lists over arrays is that they allow for constant-time insertions and deletions at the beginning of the list, while arrays require linear time to perform these operations at the beginning. On the other hand, arrays offer constant-time access to elements, while linked lists require linear time to access elements, as they have to traverse the list to find a specific element.

Another advantage of linked lists is that they can be used to implement data structures with more advanced behavior, such as stacks and queues.

In conclusion, linked lists can be useful when you need a dynamic data structure that allows constant-time insertions and deletions at the beginning, and when you don't need constant-time access to elements.
